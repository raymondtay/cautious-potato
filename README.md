# Cautious Potato

Don't ask me why that name, it was completely generated by `github`.

Anyway, that's not what i am here to discuss. What i am really here to discuss
is to leverage a tool to discover some realities about our data, especially
more so when we start using Apache Spark and its bretheren [Databricks](https://databricks.com)

First things first, i think its important to establish why i started this
exploratory work. During the course of certain MVPs and my own past experience
in building small, medium to medium-large data pipelines with Apache Spark and
is derivaties; it occurred to me that there was not a proper way to unit-test
the data (yes, i meant unit-test the data in runtime).

[deequ](https://github.com/awslabs/deequ) is a open source project released by
AWS Labs that claims to be able to do this.
